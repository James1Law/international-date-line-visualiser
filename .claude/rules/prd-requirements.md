# PRD Requirements

Every feature must have clear requirements before implementation.

## Primary PRD
The main PRD for this project is: `ship-timezone-visualizer-brief.md`

## Before starting any feature:
1. Reference the relevant section in the PRD
2. Confirm the acceptance criteria are clear
3. If requirements are ambiguous, ask for clarification before coding

## Feature documentation:
- Each feature should map to a specific section in the PRD
- Note any deviations from the PRD and get approval first
- Update the PRD if requirements change during development
