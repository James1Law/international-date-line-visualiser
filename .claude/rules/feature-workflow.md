# Feature Workflow

Work on ONE feature at a time. Do not start a new feature until the current one is complete.

## Definition of "complete":
- All tests pass
- Code is reviewed/approved
- Feature works as specified in PRD
- No known bugs

## Feature order for this project (from PRD):
1. Basic map rendering with nautical chart styling
2. Time zone lines (every 15° longitude)
3. Draggable ship icon with position display
4. Real-time time/date calculations based on longitude
5. Route drawing (waypoint placement)
6. Route animation with time updates
7. Date line crossing detection and alerts
8. Final polish and styling

## When working on a feature:
- Focus only on that feature
- Don't refactor unrelated code
- Don't add "nice to have" improvements to other areas
- Complete it before moving on
